Rmarkdown
Create and reasonably format an RMarkdown document for this analysis. Specifically:
• Include a title and your name as the author within the opening YAML;
• Use a hyperlink to link to the source of your data;
• Use appropriate headers to signify each visualization;
• Include code chunks for data manipulation and visualization so we can understand the code and analysis
you ran to create the graphs;
• Hide warning messages and unnecessary printing of data;

Four ggplot2 graphs
Your analysis should have four data visualizations of distinct graph types, made with ggplot2. Across all four graphs, use a total of:
• Six different aesthetics;
• Six different non-aesthetic options;
• Five different geoms;
• Two different scales (meaning change the default scale used for at least two aesthetics).

Further, each graph must include:
• Correct usage of all visual encodings;
• Appropriate data sourcing;
• Proper labeling of ALL visual encodings;
• An appropriate title and subtitle;
• The co

Next steps:
- Read in file
- figure out how to sum the projects with the same address to create total project cost variable (like I did in Stata)
- maybe think about adding in the market rate data from here: https://octo.quickbase.com/db/bit4krbdh?a=q&qid=44
  - also email DMPED about it
- Create ratios of incentive amount to affordable housing production
  - Basically affordable units per dollar spent on the incentive
  - When I have the total project amounts I can divide the particular incentive amount by the total     project amount (for projects with only 1 funding source this will just be 1) and then divide by     the affordable units 
- Look at how many projects had multiple funding sources
- Look at which funding sources are most often used in combination (are there certain ones used more often alone or in combination?)
- Look at projects that didn't have any affordable housing (maybe manually)
- Re-read the report to see what other things they did and what I can build on



```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(tidyverse)
library(haven)
```

```{r}

dc_housing_investment <- read_csv("dc-housing-investment.csv") %>% 
  rename(
    year = `FY`,
    incentive_name = `Incentive Name`,
    recipient_name = `Recipient Name`,
    incentive_amount = `Incentive Amount`,
    investment_address = `MAR Address of Investment`,
    ward = `MAR_Ward`,
    ami_30 = `30% AMI`,
    ami_50 = `50% AMI`,
    ami_60 = `60% AMI`,
    ami_80 = `80% AMI`,
    total_affordable = `Total Affordable Units Produced or Preserved`,
    )

total_proj_data <- dc_housing_investment %>% 
  group_by(investment_address) %>% 
  summarize(total_proj_investment = sum(incentive_amount))

dc_housing_investment <- 
  left_join(dc_housing_investment, total_proj_data, by = "investment_address")

```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
